## About Me

I am a Computer Science Engineering student (CSE’26) at Kongu Engineering College with a strong interest in Full Stack Development, Backend Engineering, and Database Management. I enjoy designing and developing end-to-end applications that solve real-world problems and deliver measurable impact.

I have hands-on experience working with modern frontend frameworks, backend technologies, databases, and deployment platforms. I have also led teams in hackathons and project-based development, including winning **1st place at Hacknovate’24**, where we built a complete placement management system.

I am currently open to opportunities as a **Full Stack Developer, Software Engineer, or Backend Developer**, where I can contribute, learn, and grow.
